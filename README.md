# Cross Platform Application Manager 

This was a project I did during my bachelors. Fairly new to programming back then :-)

It is a simple cross platform application manager system which can control and monitor the applications on both your IOS and ANDROID devices. This was built for Object Oriented Programming course. 

It is nothing fancy but clearly demonstrates the power of object oriented concepts.
